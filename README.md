# Web Application Security Testing
This repository contains project aimed at learning about web security concepts and techniques. This project focuses on a specific vulnerability or attack scenario and provides step-by-step instructions on how to identify, exploit, and mitigate the associated risks.
# Project Overview
1. Identifying and Exploiting SQL Injection Vulnerabilities using bWAPP
 - Introduction: Learn how to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities using the bWAPP web application.  
 - Pre-requisites: Basic understanding of web applications and SQL.  
 - Lab Set-up: Install bWAPP and Burp Suite, configure database connections.  
 - Exercises: Identify SQL injection vulnerabilities, craft injection payloads, and mitigate the risks.

2. Finding and Exploiting Command Injection Flaws using DVWA 
  - Introduction: Explore command injection vulnerabilities and their potential impact on web servers.
  -  Pre-requisites: Basic understanding of web applications and command line interfaces.
  - Lab Set-up: Install DVWA and Burp Suite, configure environments for testing command injection vulnerabilities.
  -  Exercises: Identify command injection vulnerabilities, execute arbitrary commands, and implement mitigation measures.
# Conclusion
Both bWAPP and DVWA serve as excellent platforms for learning about web application vulnerabilities. While DVWA focuses on a range of vulnerabilities with adjustable security levels, bWAPP offers a broader set of vulnerabilities, making both tools valuable for ethical hacking practice and enhancing security skills.
